I'm thrilled to present HR ANALYTICS, my first Power BI project ðŸ˜ƒ.

OBJECTIVE: 

By developing an HR Analytics Dashboard, assist a company in raising employee performance and retention (lowering attrition).

INSIGHTS:

1. Education: Life science majors made up the largest group of departing employees (38%). 

2. Age: The age group of 26 to 35 employees has the highest attrition rate. 

3. Job role: The number of Laboratory technicians who departed the position peaked at 62. 

4. Salary slab: Of the employees that departed, the greatest number (163) received salaries of up to 5k. 

The age group of 26 to 35 has the highest percentage of employment attrition. Certain possibilities point to issues with better career opportunities and a higher degree of job satisfaction. 

The most employees with salaries under 5k have a higher attrition rate. 

The HR department can identify key performance indicators and reduce attrition by spotting possible problems based on the data above. 

Thanks to Rishabh Mishra for creating amazing YouTube tutorial on this project ðŸ˜Š.
